Performance Analysis:

Adding/ removing elements at the start of the list:
- LinkedList: Faster for large sizes
- ArrayList: Slower because of shifting elements

Random Access:
- ArrayList: Faster due to indexed access
- LinkedList: Slower because of traversal

Conclusion:
- Use LinkedList for frequent insertions/removals
- Use ArrayList for fast random access
